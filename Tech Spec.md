TechSpec.md — Harvard-Westlake GeoGuessr (Comprehensive)

⸻

0. System Overview

Harvard-Westlake GeoGuessr consists of two distinct but connected web applications built on a shared backend and database:
    1.    Game Client — the public-facing site where users play GeoGuessr-style games.
    2.    Creation / Submission Client — a restricted site used by students to submit new locations, images, and metadata.

Both clients:
    •    Are built in React for cross-platform compatibility (desktop + mobile)
    •    Share authentication, data models, and APIs
    •    Communicate with a Firebase-backed backend

⸻

1. Technology Stack

Frontend (Both Clients)
    •    Language: TypeScript
    •    Framework: React
    •    Routing: React Router
    •    State Management: React Context + Reducers
    •    Rendering:
    •    HTML5 Canvas (image display, map overlay)
    •    SVG (campus map layers, markers)
    •    Deployment Target: Web (PWA-ready)

⸻

Backend / Services
    •    Backend Platform: Firebase
    •    Authentication: Firebase Authentication
    •    Database: Firebase Firestore
    •    File Storage: Firebase Cloud Storage
    •    Server Logic: Firebase Cloud Functions

⸻

Firebase Services Used
    •    Firebase Auth (user identity)
    •    Firestore (structured game + submission data)
    •    Cloud Storage (images & videos)
    •    Cloud Functions (scoring, validation, matchmaking)

⸻

2. High-Level Architecture

[ Game Client (React) ] ─┐
                         ├── Firebase SDK ── Firestore
[ Creation Client ] ─────┘                     |
                                               ├── Cloud Storage
                                               └── Cloud Functions

No traditional REST server is required; both clients interface directly with Firebase via SDKs and callable functions.

3. Authentication & User Identity

UserIdentityService (Frontend)

Handles login, logout, and session persistence.

Interacts With: Firebase Auth

Variables
    •    currentUser: User | null
    •    authState: enum { LOADING, AUTHENTICATED, ANONYMOUS }

Methods
    •    signInWithEmail()
    •    signInAnonymously()
    •    signOut()
    •    onAuthStateChanged()

⸻

User (Shared Model)

Variables
    •    uid: string
    •    displayName: string
    •    profilePictureURL: string
    •    rank: number
    •    stats: UserStats
    •    roles: enum { PLAYER, CREATOR, ADMIN }

Roles determine access to the Creation Client.
